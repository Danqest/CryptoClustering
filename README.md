# CryptoClustering

The project is an exercise in performing data analysis using unsupervised learning with Python, specifically using cluster and principal component analysis.
Data on cryptocurrency is taken from a raw format and transformed using a scaling method from the sklearn libary.
Cluster analysis is then performed on this scaled data, then again after a principal component analysis (PCA) reduction technique is used.
The results of the two analyses are then compared graphically and conclusions are then drawn.
